PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The objective of this project is to design and implement a POC of a “CRM” system capable of managing the following minimal core entities:
- Users
- Person
- Company
- WebformSubmission

The CRM will expose a set of RESTful APIs required to seamlessly integrate with a custom Drupal module developed by COMMpla and provided for the task.
This module will be responsible for periodically sending contact data and webform submissions to the CRM via a cron-based process, ensuring reliable and asynchronous data synchronization.


SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The entire solution will be containerized using Docker and will include at least the following components:
1. Drupal Instance
	- Configured with the custom module installed (provided)
	- Responsible for collecting contact data and webform submissions
	- Periodically sends data to the CRM APIs via cron jobs

2. Frontend Application
	- Provides a user interface for visualizing and managing Users, Persons, and Webform Submissions
	- Includes search and filtering capabilities for all supported entities

3. Backend API
	- Exposes REST APIs to receive, store, and retrieve data from Drupal
	- Implements the business logic of the CRM

4. Database Layer
	- Based on MySQL
	Stores all CRM entities and related metadata

TECHNOLOGY STACK
The project will leverage the following technologies:

- Backend / API: PHP or Django
- Frontend: React or Angular
- CMS Integration: Drupal (with a custom module)
- Database: MySQL
- Infrastructure: Docker (multi-container setup)

EXPECTED OUTCOME
The final outcome will be a fully containerized POC demonstrating:

- End-to-end data flow from Drupal to the CRM
- Proper API-based integration between systems
- A functional frontend for data visualization and search
- A modular and extensible architecture suitable for future production development

The frontend must support the following user stories:

- Enable full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the Person entity.
- Implement a mechanism to receive webform submission data, where the email address is always mandatory.
- Automatically associate each webform submission with an existing Person in the CRM, based on the email address.
- If the related Person does not exist, automatically create a new Person record and link it to the incoming webform submission.

- Ensure that webform submission data is displayed in a flexible and dynamic way, considering that the structure and fields of webforms may vary.
- Include the source website as one of the tags associated with the Person and/or the webform submission when data is pushed to the CRM.
- Provide the ability to import Person data via CSV, through a guided import wizard that allows users to map CSV fields to CRM attributes.
